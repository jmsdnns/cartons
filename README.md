Hello, and welcome to Cartons!

This project is where I store Rust implementations of ideas I build while learning Rust. My hope in sharing them is that they can act as a kind of rosetta stone for experienced programmers that are curious about Rust.

## Relevant Tools

- [just](https://just.systems/man/en/): Super handy tool to save and run commands. Some of the projects have `.justfile` that shows what commands I use with the project. Especially handy when using containers or VMs.
- [containerd](https://containerd.io/): The best way to manage to containers. It has completely replaced docker for me.
- [limavm](https://lima-vm.io/): My favorite way to manage local VMs during development.
